By doing this workshop we learn the importance of setting variable to safe empty state to avoid getting garbage values while executing the program. In addition to this we learn how to reuse the functions repeatedlty to avoid duplication of code and how to make our program more efficient with minimal coding. We also learn about constructor overloads and how to use them in our code. Destructors are also very important in order to clear the memory. This is done by deallocating the dynamic memory and freeing up memory space. Moreover it shows us how to access private data members. We aslo learn the use am importance of iomanip library which helps us in manipulation of our output such as setting precison of decimals and many more.
